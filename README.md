Solving semantic puzzles, like https://semantle.com

Solution components comprise:

* Two vocabulary options - english words set and unigram frequency
* Two semantic models - word2vec and USE
* Two solver/search strategies - cohort and gradient

These are then combined in a variety of different notebooks:

* Notebooks exploring how each solver/search works
* Notebook comparing solvers and human guesses
* Notebook for playing online
* Notebook for statistically testing performance

And also use some utilities:

* Semantle simulator to stand in for a remote game
* Performance measurement utilities
